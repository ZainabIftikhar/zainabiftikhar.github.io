# Hi, I'm Zainab.

I'm a Ph.D. Candidate at [Brown](https://www.brown.edu) studying Computer Science. I work in the [Brown HCI Lab](https://hci.brown.edu/) advised by [Jeff Huang](https://jeffhuang.com/). 

This is my personal website, hosted at [zainabiftikhar.com](https://zainabiftikhar.com/) built on [jekyll].
